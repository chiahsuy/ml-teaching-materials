    "# Hyperparameter Tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "When we call `fit()` on an estimator, it learns the parameters of the algorithm that make it fit the data best. However, some parameters are not directly learned within an estimator. These parameters are often referred to as hyperparameters, and include thing like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- depth of a decision tree\n",
    "- alpha for regularization\n",
    "- kernel for support vector machines\n",
    "- number of clusters for centroidal clustering\n",

    "### Smoothing\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we prevent overfit in our machine learning models? One strategy is to use regularization to affect *smoothing* in the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Regularization is designed to penalize model complexity, therefore the higher the alpha, the less complex the model, decreasing the error due to variance (overfit). Alphas that are too high on the other hand increase the error due to bias (underfit). It is important, therefore to choose an optimal alpha such that the error is minimized in both directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scikit-learn library offers a few popular techniques for regularization, including `LASSO`, `Ridge`, and `ElasticNet`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Lasso](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.Lasso.html) (L1 Regularization) is a linear model trained with L1 prior as the regularizer. Lasso forces weak features to have zeroes as coefficients, effectively dropping the least predictive features. Technically the Lasso model is optimizing the same objective function as the Elastic Net with `l1_ratio=1.0` (no L2 penalty).\n",
    "- [Ridge](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.Ridge.html#sklearn.linear_model.Ridge) Regression (L2 Regularization) solves a regression model where the loss function is the linear least squares function and regularization is given by the l2-norm. Ridge assigns every feature a weight, but spreads the coefficient values out more equally, shrinking but still maintaining less predictive features.\n",
    "- [ElasticNet](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.ElasticNet.html#sklearn.linear_model.ElasticNet) performs a linear regression with combined L1 and L2 priors as a regularizer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Each regularizer has an `alpha` hyperparameter that helps to determine how much smoothing to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the default alpha values for each of the regularizers? What happens when you change them?"
