    "# Get the Yellowbrick Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "Yellowbrick gives easy access to several datasets that are used for the examples in the documentation and testing. These datasets are hosted in our CDN and must be downloaded for use. Typically, when a user calls one of the data loader functions, e.g. `load_bikeshare()` the data is automatically downloaded if it's not already on the user's computer. However, for development and testing, or if you know you will be working without internet access, it might be easier to simply download all the data at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "First clone yellowbrick as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ git clone git@github.com:DistrictDataLabs/yellowbrick.git     \n",
    "$ cd yellowbrick      \n",
    "    $ pip install -r requirements.txt     \n",
    "$ pip install -e .      \n",
    "    \n",
    "The data downloader script can then be run as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ python -m yellowbrick.download\n",
    "\n",
    "This will download the data to the fixtures directory inside of the Yellowbrick site packages. You can specify the location of the download either as an argument to the downloader script (use `--help` for more details) or by setting the `$YELLOWBRICK_DATA` environment variable. This is the preferred mechanism because this will also influence how data is loaded in Yellowbrick.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Note: Developers who have downloaded data from Yellowbrick versions earlier than v1.0 may experience some problems with the older data format. If this occurs, you can clear out your data cache as follows:_\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ python -m yellowbrick.download --cleanup\n",
    "\n",
    "_This will remove old datasets and download the new ones. You can also use the `--no-download` flag to simply clear the cache without re-downloading data. Users who are having difficulty with datasets can also use this or they can uninstall and reinstall Yellowbrick using `pip`._"
